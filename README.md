## Code Review for HTML Document

The provided code is an HTML document that represents a webpage for the Griot Theatre Company's featured shows. Here is a review of the code:

### Structure and Organization
- The HTML document follows the standard structure with the `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` elements.
- The document includes appropriate comments to describe the purpose of each section and element.

### HTML Elements and Attributes
- The document uses semantic HTML elements such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`, which improves accessibility and readability.
- The `<meta>` elements are used correctly to specify the character encoding and viewport settings.
- The `<title>` element provides a meaningful title for the webpage.
- The `<link>` element is used to import an external CSS file and a Google Fonts stylesheet.
- The `<img>` elements use the `alt` attribute to provide alternative text for accessibility.

### CSS Styling
- The document references an external CSS file named "style.css" to apply styles to the webpage.
- However, the content of the CSS file is not provided, so it is not possible to review the styling.

### Accessibility
- The document includes alternative text for images using the `alt` attribute, which is important for users who rely on screen readers.
- The document uses semantic HTML elements, which can improve accessibility by providing more meaningful structure and context.

### Best Practices
- The document follows best practices by using a consistent indentation style and including appropriate closing tags for all elements.
- The document includes a `<meta>` element to specify the character encoding, which is important for proper rendering of special characters.
- The document includes a `<meta>` element to set the viewport, which ensures that the webpage is displayed correctly on different devices.

### Possible Improvements
- It would be beneficial to include the actual content of the external CSS file "style.css" to review the styling and ensure it is consistent with the HTML structure.
- The document could benefit from additional sections or elements to provide more information about the featured shows, such as show descriptions or links to purchase tickets.
- The navigation links in the `<nav- The navigation links in the `<nav>` section are currently placeholders with "#" as the href attribute. It would be beneficial to update these links with the appropriate URLs for the Home, About Us, Shows, and Contact Us pages.
- The images used for the show tiles are currently placeholders with generic names like "a-raisin-in-the-sun-theater-1.png". It would be better to use actual images that represent the featured shows.
- The show dates, locations, and ticket prices are currently static and do not change for each show tile. It would be more useful to dynamically populate this information based on the actual shows being featured.
- The footer section currently only includes a copyright statement. It would be beneficial to include additional information such as contact details or social media links.

Overall, the HTML structure and organization are well-implemented, but the content and functionality of the webpage could be improved to provide more meaningful and dynamic information about the featured shows.
